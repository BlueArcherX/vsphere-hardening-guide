Audit Check limit-setinfo-size
</H4><p>
VMware has the ability to add custom “name = value” variables into the VMX Configuration files 
of the individual Guest Virtual Machines.  By default, the limit on this is 1MB, which makes 
for an extremely large configuration file.  An indirect DOS attack could be mounted, increasing 
all the VMX files by this maximum value, which would dramatically increase the startup time for 
each guest.
</p>
To limit the amount of custom information, the following VMX parameters are recommended:
(this is the default value, a smaller value is generally recommended, to be determined by the 
policy and requirements of individual VMs):
<b></br>
	Tools.setInfo.sizeLimit=1048567
</b></p>
<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u>
<pre>
vmrun -T esx -h https://&LThost ip&GT/sdk -u &LTuserid&GT -p &LTpassword&GT readvariable &LTpath to vmx file&GT Tools.setInfo.sizeLimit
(note that this can only check running VMs, use vmware-cmd for dormant hosts)

PowerCLI:
    $vm | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name  "tools.setInfo.sizeLimit"

Tools.setInfo.sizeLimit=1048567 is Compliant, other values or -1 (blank) is Non-Compliant
This value will of course vary from organisation to organisation.
