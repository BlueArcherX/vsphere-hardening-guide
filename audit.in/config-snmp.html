Audit Check config-snmp 
</H4><p>
SNMP is one of the basic protocols used in performance management, allowing centralized collection of performance data, analagous to the central
logging function that syslog uses.
</p>
SNMP versions 1 and 2 (2 or 2c is the most commonly used version of SNMP) are clear text protocols.  SNMP version 3 introduced encryption, but
is not widely deployed.
</p>
In a virtual infrastructure, if SNMP is not used for performance management, then SNMP should be disabled on each ESX host.  
</p>
If it is required, however, it should:<pre>
	- Have a complex string (“public” and “private” should not be used)
	- Be read only (unless read/write is required)
	- Have a protected path between the management inteface of the ESX host and the NMS (Network Management System) that is sending / receiving
          SNMP messages.</pre>
