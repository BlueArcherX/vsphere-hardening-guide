Audit Check isolate-mgmt-network-vlan
</H4><p>

The vSphere management port group should be in a dedicated VLAN on a common vSwitch. 
The vSwitch can be shared with production (virtual machine) traffic, as long as the 
vSphere management port group’s VLAN is not used by production virtual machines. Check 
that the network segment is not routed, except possibly to networks where other 
management-related entities are found. In particular, make sure that production 
virtual machine traffic cannot be routed to this network.

This is a manual check, in conjunction with a check on the physical switch and vlan infrastructure
