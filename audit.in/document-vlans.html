Audit Check document-vlans
</H4><p>
As we should be aware by now, the end role of most Virtual Infrastructures is to eventually communicate with the connected physical network 
and “real world” devices.  This means that all VLANs within an infrastructure should be documented, and periodically reviewed for congruence 
with the VLAN configuration and documentation on adjacent switches and routers.


</p>
<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u></p>
This is in the end a <b>manual check</b> - the documentation and the physical infrastructure must be reviewed to see that the documented vlans exist, and that the virtual and physical infrastructure matches, is accurate and complete. 
 
However, these commands can be used as the basis for this documentation:</p>
<pre>
	vicfg-vswitch.pl --server &LTserver ip address&GT --username &LTusername&GT --password &LTpassword&GT -l
or
	esxcli &LTconnection information&GT network vswitch standard list
or
        Get-VirtualPortGroup -Standard | Select virtualSwitch, Name, VlanID

Verify by using the vSphere Client to connect to the vCenter Server and as administrator: 
1. Go to "Home > Inventory > Hosts and Clusters". 
2. Select each ESXi host with virtual switches connected to active VM's requiring securing. 
3. Go to  
"Configuration > Network > vSwitch(?) > Properties > Ports > [?Portgroup Name?] > VLAN ID" 
4. Verify and record VLAN ID's in a tracking system approved by your organization or 
following industry best practices.
