Audit Check disable-stp
</H4><p>
All hosts and networks are defined internally on a VMware host (in the associated VMX files), so ESX (or ESXi) will only read network frames
that are destined for VMs on the host, or any of the management or VMKernel functions on the host.  Because of this, any frame that is 
accepted inbound on one port will never “find it’s way” back out a different port.  This has a few advantages – not only does it restrict 
the traffic on the vSwitch to frames which actually belong on that switch, it removes the need for Spanning Tree entirely, since the concept 
of a network loop is no longer in play.  This considerably 
reduces the attack surface on the vSphere virtual network infrastructure.

<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u></p>
This is in the end a <b>manual check</b> - On all connected physical switches, login and ensure that Spanning Tree is disabled on physical
ports connected to the virtual infrastructure, or that Spanning Tree “portfast” is configured on those ports.  In many infrastructures 
this step can be scripted, but the scripts involved will target the physical infrastructure, not the virtual infrastructure.
