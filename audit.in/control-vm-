Audit Check VMX20 - Limit Local Logging
</H4><p>
By default, operations on a Guest Virtual Machine go into a series of log files in the same directory as the virtual machine’s VMX Configuration 
file.  As with all local logs, a mechanism to limit total disk space is recommended – if these logs are permitted to grow without bound, then 
over time they’ll fill up the filesystem, interfering with normal system operations such as snapshots (which of course require disk space), or 
even interfering with powering on guest VMs.

To limit the size and number of logs, the following VMX parameters are recommended:
<b>
	Log.rotateSize=1000000
	Log.keepOld=10</b>


<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u>
vmrun -T esx -h https://&LThost ip&GT/sdk -u &LTuserid&GT -p &LTpassword&GT readvariable &LTpath to vmx file&GT runtimeConfig Log.rotateSize
vmrun -T esx -h https://&LThost ip&GT/sdk -u &LTuserid&GT -p &LTpassword&GT readvariable &LTpath to vmx file&GT runtimeConfig Log.keepOld
(note that this can only check running VMs, use vmware-cmd for dormant hosts)

Log.rotateSize=1000000 is Compliant, other values or -1 is Non-Compliant
Log.keepOld=10 is Compliant, other Values, Blank or -1 is non-Compliant
