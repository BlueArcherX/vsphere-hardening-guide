Audit Check apply-patches 
</H4><p>
Just like traditional platforms and operating systems, ESX, ESXi and vCenter hosts all need timely updates and patches.  
VMware has a quick patch cycle, but it’s still important to patch as soon as patches are available, or shortly thereafter.  
This is simplified with the use of VMware vCenter Update Manager (VUM), which from a single platform can patch multiple platforms.

<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u></p><pre>
	For version 4.x:
		vihostupdate.pl –server &LTip address&GT --username &LTusername&GT --password &LTpassword&GT --query
	For version 5.x:
		esxcli -s &LTserver&GT -u &LTusername&GT -p &LTpassword&GT software vib list
        In PowerCLI (5.x or newer):
                $esxcli = $esxh | Get-EsxCli
                $patches = $esxcli.software.vib.list() | Select-Object @{N="VMHostName"; E={$VMHostName}}, *

This is a manual assessment, based on the patch information collected below.  Patch dates can be used to assess against an organisation's policy.
