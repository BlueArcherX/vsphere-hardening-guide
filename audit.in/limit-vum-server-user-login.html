Because of the power available within the VUM interface, it’s a good idea to log its 
use, to ensure that only valid personnel are accessing it, at the correct times.  
It’s also good to track failed attempts to login, which might catch penetration attempts 
and attacks.

</p>
To audit login events (to verify good behaviour or bad), a good starting point is to audit 
the following Windows Events:
</p>
<b>Event ID  675</b> – incorrect password
<b>Event ID  676</b> – failed login attempt for reasons other than incorrect password (mistyped username, account locked etc)
<b>Event ID  680</b> - Successful login
<b>Event ID 4624</b> - Successful login
<b>Event ID 4672</b> - Special Privileges Assigned
<b>Event ID 4625</b> - Failed Login Attempt

</p>
These events also log the station that originated the request

While these events can be parsed using WMIC NTEVENT, this method is very CPU intensive
</p>
PSLOGLIST (part of the Microsoft Systinternal Suite) gives us a much better approach to this.  To extract occurrences of these three events for instance, 
you might use a command string like:
<pre>
	psloglist \\&LTVCENTERSERVERNAME&GT -u &LTuserid&GT -p &LTpassword&GT –s –I 676,675,680 Security
</pre>
