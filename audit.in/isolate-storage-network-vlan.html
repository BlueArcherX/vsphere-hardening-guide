Audit Check isolate-storage-network-vlan  
</H4><p>
Ensure that IP-based storage traffic is isolated. 
Virtual machines might share virtual switches and VLANs with the IP-based storage 
configurations. IP-based storage includes iSCSI and NFS.  This type of configuration might 
expose IP-based storage traffic to unauthorized virtual machine users. IP-based storage 
frequently is not encrypted. It can be viewed by anyone with access to this network. To 
restrict unauthorized users from viewing the IP-based storage traffic, the IP-based storage 
network should be logically separated from the production traffic. Configuring the IP-based 
storage adaptors on separate VLANs or network segments from the VMkernel management and 
service console network will limit unauthorized users from viewing the traffic.
</p>
Storage port groups should be in a dedicated VLAN on a common vSwitch. The vSwitch can be 
shared with production (virtual machine) traffic, as long as the storage port group’s 
VLAN is not used by production virtual machines. Check for usage of the VLAN ID on non-storage 
port groups. Check that the VLAN is isolated and not routed in the physical network.
