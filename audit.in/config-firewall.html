Unrestricted access to services running on an ESXi host can exposes a host to outside 
attacks and unauthorized access.  Reduce the risk by configuring the ESXi firewall to 
only allow access to permitted services from authorized networks.

The firewall settings can be listed using the commands listed below.  
These settings need to be assessed manually against the corporate policies for 
authorization and access to each of the specific services.
