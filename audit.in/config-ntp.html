Audit Check config-ntp

Accurate time in an organization is critical – it allows correlation of events between disparate hosts, accurate scheduling of events, and is
the basis for many facets of system administration.  In most cases systems run on UTC time, then have their timezone set with an offset.  This
allows events to be correlated simply, even if the target hosts are in different timezones.
