Audit Check limit-console-connections-one
</H4><p>
In VMware ESX, the “Console” tab for each Virtual Machine allows access to the screen and keyboard of the VM.  However, because of the virtual 
nature of these resources, multiple administrative users can access them.  If one remains “silent”, the other may not be aware of the second 
session.  For this reason, limiting the number of administrative console sessions to 1 is recommended.  This is done by adding one line to the 
VMX file for the affected VM:
<b><br>
	RemoteDisplaymaxConnections=1</b>
</p>
<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u>
<pre>
vmrun -T esx -h https://&LThost ip&GT/sdk -u &LTuserid&GT -p &LTpassword&GT readvariable &LTpath to vmx file&GT runtimeConfig RemoteDisplaymaxConnections
(note that this can only check running VMs, use vmware-cmd for dormant hosts)

PowerCLI:
    $vm | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name  "RemoteDisplay.maxConnections" 

A Value of 1 is Compliant
A Values &GT1 or empty results are Non-Compliant
