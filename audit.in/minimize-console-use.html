Audit Check VMP05 - Minimize the use of VM Console Operations 
</H4><p>
While the vSphere client is the most convenient administration interface for the virtual 
infrastructure, if what is required is the keyboard and screen of a Guest VM, using the 
vSphere client gives quite a bit more access than is required.  The vCenter / vSphere 
client interface controls all facets of the virtual machine, including the virtual 
hardware and BIOS, as well as interfaces to the underlying network and storage.  
</p
A much better approach is to use the traditional remote access tools that would be 
used for a physical host.  That is to say, SSH for Linux hosts, and most likely RDP 
for Windows hosts.  Not only is the security exposure limited, but the screen and 
keyboard performance is generally better.

<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u></p>
Unfortunately, a policy of using vCenter or the vSphere client only when required is 
not an easy one to audit.  At best it’s a manual assessment of work habits.
