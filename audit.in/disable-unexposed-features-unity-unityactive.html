Audit Check disable-unexposed-features-unity-unityactive 
</H4><p>
Because VMware virtual machines are designed to work on both vSphere as well as hosted 
virtualization platforms such as Workstation and Fusion, there are some VMX parameters 
that don’t apply when running on vSphere.  Although the functionality governed by these 
parameters is not exposed on ESX, explicitly disabling them will reduce the potential for 
vulnerabilities.  Disabling these features reduces the number of vectors through which 
a guest can attempt to influence the host, and thus may help prevent successful exploits.
</p>
The affected VMX setting is:
<b><br>
	isolation.tools.unityActive.disable=TRUE
</b></p>
<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u>
<pre>
vmrun -T esx -h https://&LThost ip&GT/sdk -u &LTuserid&GT -p &LTpassword&GT readvariable &LTpath to vmx file&GT isolation.tools.unityActive.disable

(note that this can only check running VMs, use vmware-cmd for dormant hosts)

PowerCLI:
    $vm | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name  "isolation.tools.unityActive.disable"

A value of "TRUE" indicates Compliance, "False" or blank indicates non-compliance
