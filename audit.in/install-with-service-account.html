Audit Check install-with-service-account 
</H4><p>
The vCenter application by default installs with “LocalSystem” privileges.  In reality, less rights are required for this service to run.  vCenter 
should be modified after installation to use a named account, with less rights (exact rights are outlined in the VMware’s installation guides).
</p>
This has the added advantage that if a back end SQL server is used for vCenter on another host, this named account can then access SQL using Windows
 User Authentication, and can be granted the specific required SQL permissions.
