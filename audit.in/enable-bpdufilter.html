Audit Check upstream-bpdu-stp
</H4><p>Verify that for virtual machines that route or bridge traffic, spanning tree 
protocol is enabled and BPDU guard and Portfast are disabled on the upstream physical 
switch port.	In the scenario where the ESXi host has a guest VM that is configured to 
perform bridging function, the VM will generate BPDU frames and send out to the VDS. 
The VDS then forwards the BPDU frames through the network adapter to the physical switch 
port. When the switch port configured with “BPDU guard” receives the BPDU frame, the 
switch disables the port and the VM looses connectivity. To avoid this network failure 
scenario while running software-bridging function on an ESXI host, customers should 
disable the “portfast” and “BPDU guard” configuration on the port and run the spanning 
tree protocol.


<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u></p>
This is a <b>manual check</b> - Routinely check that for virtual machines that perform 
bridging or routing, the first upstream physical switch port is configured with BPDU Guard 
and Portfast disabled and Spanning Tree Protocol enabled.
