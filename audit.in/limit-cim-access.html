Audit Check limit-cim-access
</H4><p>
The CIM API interface allows access to lower level, hardware components in the system.  Because of this low-level access, it’s recommended that
an account with restricted access be created for CIM access (any local account has CIM access)
</p>
<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u></p>
For a manual assessment of user privileges, based on CIM management requirements

    get-vmhostaccount -server $esxh.name
