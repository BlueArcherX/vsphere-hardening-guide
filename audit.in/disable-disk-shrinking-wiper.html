Audit Check disable-disk-shrinking-wiper - Prevent Virtual Disk Wipe
</H4><p>
The Disk Wiping operation can be executed by a user within a guest VM, by using the commands within the VMware Tools application.  
While this can be useful in clearing disk sectors, it is a CPU intensive operation that can affect not only the intended VM, 
but all VMs on the host platform.   For this reason, disabling this feature is recommended.  This is done by adding 
this line to the VMX file for the affected VM:<b><br>

	isolation.tools.diskWiper=TRUE</b>
<p>
<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u>
<pre>

vmrun -T esx -h https://&LThost ip&GT/sdk -u &LTuserid&GT -p &LTpassword&GT readvariable &LTpath to vmx file&GT runtimeConfig isolation.tools.diskWiper
(note that this can only check running VMs, use vmware-cmd for dormant hosts)

In PowerCLI:
    $vm | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name  "isolation.tools.diskWiper.disable"

"TRUE" results are Compliant
"FALSE" or empty results are Non-compliant

</pre><b><u>Audit Results:</b></u><p>
