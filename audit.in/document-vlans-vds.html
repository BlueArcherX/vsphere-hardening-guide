As we should be aware by now, the end role of most Virtual Infrastructures is to eventually communicate with the connected physical network 
and “real world” devices.  This means that all VLANs within an infrastructure should be documented, and periodically reviewed for congruence 
with the VLAN configuration and documentation on adjacent switches and routers.

<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u></p>
This is in the end a <b>manual check</b> - the documentation itself must be reviewed to see that it exists, is accurate and complete.  However, 
these two commands can be used as the basis for this documentation:</p>
<pre>
	vicfg-vswitch.pl --server &LTserver ip address&GT --username &LTusername&GT --password &LTpassword&GT -l
or
	esxcli &LTconnection information&GT network vswitch standard list

From the vSphere Client log into vCS. Home > Inventory > Networking. 
Select dvSwitch and dvPortgroup and "Edit Settings > Policies > VLAN > VLAN ID". 
Verify and record VLAN ID's in a tracking system approved by your organization or 
following industry best practices.
