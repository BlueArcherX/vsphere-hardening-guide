Audit Check apply-vum-os-patches

Patching is a reality in every IT department in every organization.  Patches are required to fix problems, to remediate security vulnerabilties, 
and in some cases to enable new OS or application features.  For this reason, “timely” application of vendor patches is a strong recommendation 
in almost every security audit document.  
</p>
The conventional wisdom has been that “timely” application of patches includes a testing phase, but unfortunately, lack of resources is a common 
thread in many IT departments.  In particular, testing of patches and updates is often not possible.  Even if resources are available, management 
will often take the approach that the vendor is best equipped to test patches.
Unfortunately, it is a periodic reality that sometimes a “bad” patch or update will slip through. Something in your environment that wasn’t tested 
for, or something that just slipped through the vendor’s process.  It is for this reason that image backups are recommended for critical components.  
For the rare case when a patch taks a service offline, an image restore is much less painless than installing the OS, then the application(s), then 
restoring the data.
</p>
Luckily, virtual infrastructure lends itself to image backups.  Many organizations simply standardize on this method for all virtual servers.

In many cases, VUM is installed on the same system as vCenter.  In this case, this benchmark is 
identical to they apply-os-patches
