Audit Check enable-remote-syslog

Remote logging (via syslog in this case) is a security measure that is recommended for almost any sensitive platform.  Not only does it ensure 
that local logs do not fill local storage, it allows combining logs from multiple sources, allowing event analysis that would otherwise not be
possible.  Just as importantly, if the ESX host is compromised, logging to a remote location ensures that a record of the compromise is stored
in at least one other location, hopefully one that the attacker has not compromised.  As a final note, remote logging is a requirement in almost
all regulatory frameworks.
