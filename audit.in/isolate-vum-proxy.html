Limit the connectivity between Update Manager and public patch repositories.
<p>
In a typical deployment, Update Manager connects to public patch repositories on the 
Internet to download patches. This connection should be limited as much as possible to 
prevent access from the outside to the Update Manager system. Any channel to the Internet 
represents a threat.

<b><u>Audit Check:</b></u>
<pre>
This is a manual assessment

Verify that there is a Web proxy between Update Manager and the Internet. Check the proxy 
settings for Update Manager to make sure they are correct. Proxy settings are given in 
the "Installing and Administering VMware vSphere Update Manager" guide > “Configuring 
Update Manager” chapter >  “Configure Update Manager Proxy Settings” section.
