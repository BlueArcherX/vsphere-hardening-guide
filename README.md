vSphere Hardening Guide Compliance Scripts.  
Based on VMware's Hardening Guide, version 5.5
All VMware Hardening Guides are homed at http://www.vmware.com/security/hardening-guides.html

These scripts are used in SANS SEC579

For usage:
- Open VMware PowerCLI
- Run the script with the target ESXi or vCenter host as the single argument
- Targeting a vCenter host will cover all attached ESXi hosts and VMs

The vCenter audit script is optimized for Windows installs, but will still run fine against the Appliance version of VC

Enjoy!
